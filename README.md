When troubleshooting it is useful to see the interfaces which are getting maximum input packets, bytes and input drops. If the number of interfaces is large, often it is possible to make some error in manual checking. This script takes show tech(ASA/FTD)  as input and prints the interfaces sorted by "1 minute input packets per second, "1 minute input bytes per second", "5 minute input packets per second", "5 minute input bytes per second, "1 minute drop rate packets per second". If there are multiple show traffic section in file e.g muliple context, it will show values are each section in same order as in file.
